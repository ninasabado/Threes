# Threes
**by Nina Sabado**

*An adaptation of the popular game Threes. Currently in command-line JS, considering eventually creating some HTML/CSS for it.*

**RUNNING THE GAME:**
I ran the game via Node.js, which had already been installed on my system from a previous JavaScrip t class I took. It has a really great I/O that I liked.

Via command line, input the arguments in this order:
````
$ node threes [# of rows] [# of columns] [% of board filled]
````

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

| COMMAND | ACTION   |
| * Configuration    |
| prob    | Change the probability of tiles being filled |
| reset   | Reset the game                               |
| quit    | Exit the game                                |
| * Movement         |
| left      Go left  |
| right     Go right |
| up        Go up    |
| down      Go down  |

**NOTE:**
Threes can only currently combine values at the edges, but I'm looking to change this soon.
